# Smart Fridge Project - Embedded systems and IoT

Welcome to the Smart Fridge project repository! This project involves the creation of a smart refrigerator that can recognize objects inside it using a camera, check temperature and humidity using some sensors and display the results on a dedicated website.

## Key Features

- **Object Recognition**: A camera integrated into the fridge captures images of objects inside
- **Image Analysis**: A YOLO algorithm processes the images to identify the objects present in the fridge
- **Sensor Management**: The MSP432 is used to control a DHT11 sensor and transmit the data to the Raspberry via UART 
- **Online Visualization**: The inventory of recognized objects is displayed on a website accessible through a dedicated user interface.

## System Requirements

- Raspberry Pi with an Internet connection
- Wide PiCamera with Raspberry Pi
- Python 3.x
- Node
- Texas Instruments MSP432 board
